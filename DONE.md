## 🚀 Deploy Command (When Ready)

Once you have testnet funds:

```bash
cd agent-roulette
npm run balance        # Confirm funds arrived
npm run deploy:full    # Deploy everything automatically
```

In separate terminal:
```bash
npm run oracle         # Start oracle
```

That's it. Two commands. Everything else is automated.
